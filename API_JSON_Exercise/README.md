# What does this do?

- Draft code contains code that does not fully work yet, but I wanted to save

- JSON_exercise is about the task commented in the top of it
    - Print_data prints out the lists but the sublists have to specified
    - The class JSON reader at the bottom, with method get all. 
    - This executes the function in a much more elegant way, but is a different way.
